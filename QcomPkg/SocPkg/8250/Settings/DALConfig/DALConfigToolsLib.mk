# Device Config user adding new xml or updating existing xml need to update
# modify the following variables: 
# 1]  INC_DEPS
# 2]  XML_DEPS
#
# XML_DEPS need to be modified if a user adds a config xml in DALConfigLib 
# folder of any of its subdirectories. The proper path of the xml file needs 
# to be appended to the variable XML_DEPS
#
# INC_DEPS need to be modified if the added config xml file includes (#include directive)
# any header file(s). Proper paths of the header files need to be appended to
# the variable INC_DEPS
# Nothing else should be modified in the file. 
#
# Any xxxx.dec Package entries meant to be added in DALConfigToolsLib.inf have to be
# now added to the DALGenLibTools.inf
